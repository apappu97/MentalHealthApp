# W/Me

W/Me ("with me") is an app that allows users to track the emotional well-being of their friends. Users input phone numbers of friends during setup. Daily check-ins consisting of three questions record how each user is doing daily. Statistics computed on a weekly basis alert friends of user if a user has a particularly bad week so that their friends can check in on them.

Built with React-Native and Firebase as part of the CS+Social Good Studio Program at Stanford University, June 2016.
